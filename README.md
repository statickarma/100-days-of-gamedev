# 100 Days Of Gamedev

My attempt at learning game development for fun. Based on
the [#100DaysOfCode](https://github.com/kallaway/100-days-of-code) challenge. It will likely not be consecutive 100 days
for me and that's okay. I'll be doing this in [python](https://www.python.org/) using [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/).

### Day 8: July 2, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Loading a sprite sheet and parsing it with 1 method.

**Thoughts**: Trying to implement OOP practices, but I wonder if those of web development apply to game dev as well.

### Day 7: July 1, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Working on creating reusable classes for game and sprites.

**Thoughts**: Had lots of fun doing this. Are you even a dev if you don't over-engineer prematurely?

### Day 6: June 30, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Created a sprite sheet animation by
following: [Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6e3_8LHc7A)
and [Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXOVcOBqFwM).

**Thoughts**: This was interesting. Previously I loaded all animation frames individually. This makes more sense, load
one image with all frames (_spritesheet_) and use code to create separate frames.

### Day 5: June 23, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Attempted to create a simple game and failed. It requires a lot more thought and planning than I
expected.

**Thoughts**: There's a part I neglected about making games: designing/planning. Showing images and moving them around
the screen is not enough to create a game. I need to think it through, design it, plan it and then execute.

### Day 4: June 22, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Created Platformer by following a list
of [tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjcN1EyupaQnHM1I9SmiXfbT6aG4ezUvu).

**Thoughts**: I did the first 9 parts. It was more of an ad-hoc kind of tutorial and not as organized as the previous
one. It was a good exercise, I think I am ready to make a simple game of my own.

### Day 3: June 18, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Created Snake by following a [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFvqStqPCRU).

**Thoughts**: This is from the same guy that created the flappy bird tutorial yesterday. Another great tutorial. I think
I should be able to create a simple game on my own now.

### Day 2: June 17, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Created Flappy Bird clone by following a [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZg49z76cLw).

**Thoughts**: This was such a great tutorial. Learned a lot: loading images, animation, sounds, game over screen. I
can't believe this was free. This should have been my first tutorial.

### Day 1: June 16, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Created Pong by following
a [tutorial](https://www.101computing.net/pong-tutorial-using-pygame-getting-started/).

**Thoughts**: It was easy to follow. Wish there was a computer paddle. Both paddles are controlled using the keyboard (
W/S and UP/DOWN keys). Encountered a few bugs while playing. I get **what** is being done but, not sure about **how**
and **why** (`blit`, `flip` and `all_sprite_list.draw()`).

### Day 0: June 15, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Installed PyCharm, python and pygame. Went
through [Python Cheat Sheet](https://programmingwithmosh.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Python-Cheat-Sheet.pdf)
by [Mosh Hamedani](https://twitter.com/moshhamedani). It was exactly what I needed to get started. I feel I know enough
to go through some pygame tutorials.

**Thoughts**: No thoughts in particular. I know how to code, and I've seen python. The syntax makes sense (`self` as
first argument to every method, not so much). Let's see how this plays out.
