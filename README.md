# 100-days-of-gamedev
My attempt at learning game development for fun. Based on the [#100DaysOfCode](https://github.com/kallaway/100-days-of-code) challenge. It will likely not be consecutive 100 days for me and that's okay. I'll be doing this in [python](https://www.python.org/) using [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/).

# Plan
1. Get familiar with python
2. Make my first game
3. todo
