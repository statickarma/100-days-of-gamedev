# 100 Days Of Gamedev - Log

### Day 0: June 15, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Installed PyCharm, python and pygame. Went through [Python Cheat Sheet](https://programmingwithmosh.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Python-Cheat-Sheet.pdf) by [Mosh Hamedani](https://twitter.com/moshhamedani). It was exactly what I needed to get started. I feel I know enough to go through some pygame tutorials.

**Thoughts:** No thoughts in particual. I know how to code and I've seen python. The syntax makes sense (`self` as first arugment to every method, not so much). Lets see how this plays out.
